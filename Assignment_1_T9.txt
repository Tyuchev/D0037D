Reflection

Approx 5 hours spent on this assignment
Most important skills worked on were parsing strings in C++ and practising some basic logical thinking.
Additionally i must continue to get used to writing C++ code.
I used information found on Stack overflow to assist me, but i made sure to only 
replicate code that i undertood how and why to use.
